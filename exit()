Help on built-in function remove in module posix:

rreemmoovvee(path, *, dir_fd=None)
    Remove a file (same as unlink()).
    
    If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory,
      and path should be relative; path will then be relative to that directory.
    dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
      If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.
