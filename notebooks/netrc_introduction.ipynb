    "In order to download imagery from the alaska satellite facility or jet propulsion laboratory you will need to create a special .netrc file in your home directory. This file will contain your username and password and will be automatically accessed when downloading imagery. If you got a HTTP 401 error when trying to download using UavsarScene or UavsarImage you will need to ensure you have this file. The period (.) in front of the name is intentional and means it will not appear in your file explorer. For more information on netrc files click [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/inetutils/manual/html_node/The-_002enetrc-file.html).\n",
